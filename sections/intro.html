          <h2 class="my-3">Game Mechanics</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Research popular earning mechanisms and spend coins on creating and training GPTs.</li>
              <li>Create GPTs with image, description, values; lower-parameter models are cheaper, and the image is unmodifiable after creation, but GPTs are trainable.</li>
              <li>GPT creation requires coins; fixed image and description; trainable with coins; marketplace for buying, selling GPTs, and trainings; GPTs based on classic transformers (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-J).</li>
              <li>Use open-source text-to-image conversion, such as stable diffusion, for card images.</li>
