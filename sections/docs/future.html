<p>In the future, we plan to implement an automatic testing system to verify the format of the sections.js file and check all the sections folders to ensure that all HTML files are present and not broken.</p>
<p>We also plan to implement a workaround to avoid CORS issues when loading external resources such as images or videos.</p>
