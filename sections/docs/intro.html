<h1 class="mb-4 text-center">Welcome to Docs!</h1>
<p>Docs is a documentation project template built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a basic structure for creating a documentation site that's easy to navigate and expand. You can use it to document anything from APIs and libraries to software projects and processes.</p>
<p>The left-hand menu lists all the sections and sub-sections of your documentation. Click on any section to expand it and see its contents. Each section can have multiple sub-sections, and you can nest them as deep as you want.</p>
<p>The right-hand pane displays the content of the selected section. You can use HTML, Markdown, or any other text format to write your documentation content. Docs will automatically load the content from the corresponding HTML file when you click on a section in the menu.</p>
<p>To get started with Docs, simply clone the repository, edit the sections.js file to add your own sections and content, and customize the styling to match your branding. You can also add your own JavaScript code to extend the functionality of the site.</p>
