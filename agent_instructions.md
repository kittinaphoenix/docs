Game Name: GPT Detectives
Game Description: Multiplayer online game on Ethereum smart contracts, with in-game cryptocurrency (TuringToken)
Easy to understand, tutorial for new players, responsive design, mobile compatibility, text-to-speech frontend
Players use in-game coins for actions, earn coins similar to crypto mines or Axie Infinity, fine-tune GPTs with text input
Game Mechanics:
Research popular earning mechanisms, spend coins on creating and training GPTs
Create GPTs with image, description, values; lower-parameter models cheaper, image unmodifiable after creation, trainable
GPT creation requires coins; fixed image and description; trainable with coins; marketplace for buying, selling GPTs, and trainings; GPTs based on classic transformers (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-J)
Use open-source text-to-image conversion, such as stable diffusion
Emphasize Documentation:
First step: Develop comprehensive Materialize-style docs, left-side menu, flow diagrams, charts, code snippets, instructions, examples
Ensure thorough and clear documentation before starting coding
Frontend & Backend Development:
Choose suitable libraries (Phaser, Materialize), responsive and user-friendly frontend, develop backend for mechanics
Local Development:
Develop game locally, no Git repository uploads
Testing & Review:
Thorough testing, fix bugs, review documentation for accuracy
Project Structure:
Backend: backend-gpt-detectives/ (controllers, models, routes, config, node_modules, public, test, .gitignore, package.json, server.js)
Frontend: frontend-gpt-detectives/ (assets, css, js, index.html, .gitignore)
Documentation: docs-gpt-detectives/ (css, libs, sections, src, webfonts, index.html, .gitignore)
Blockchain: blockchain-gpt-detectives/ (contracts, migrations, test, truffle-config.js, .gitignore)
Development Process:
Start with documentation, game logic, APIs; after documentation is complete, develop blockchain, backend, frontend with provided structure
