Game Name: GPT Detectives
Game Description: Multiplayer online game on Ethereum smart contracts, with in-game cryptocurrency (TuringToken)
Easy to understand, tutorial for new players, responsive design, mobile compatibility, text-to-speech frontend
Players use in-game coins for actions, earn coins similar to crypto mines or Axie Infinity, fine-tune GPTs with text input
Game Mechanics:
- Research popular earning mechanisms, spend coins on creating and training GPTs
- Create GPTs with image, description, values; lower-parameter models cheaper, image unmodifiable after creation, trainable
- GPT creation requires coins; fixed image and description; trainable with coins; marketplace for buying, selling GPTs, and trainings; GPTs based on classic transformers (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-J)
- Use open-source text-to-image conversion, such as stable diffusion
Emphasize Documentation:
- First step: Develop comprehensive Materialize-style docs, left-side menu, flow diagrams, charts, code snippets, instructions, examples
- Ensure thorough and clear documentation before starting coding
Frontend & Backend Development:
- Choose suitable libraries (Phaser, Materialize), responsive and user-friendly frontend, develop backend for mechanics
Local Development:
- Develop game locally, no Git repository uploads
Testing & Review:
- Thorough testing, fix bugs, review documentation for accuracy
Project Structure:
- Backend: gptDetectives-Backend/ (sample structure and files included)
- Frontend: gptDetectives-frontend/ (sample structure and files included)
- Documentation: gptDetectives-docs/ (sample structure and files included)
- Blockchain: gptDetectives-blockchain/ (sample structure and files included)
Development Process:
- Start with documentation, game logic, APIs; after documentation is complete, develop blockchain, backend, frontend with provided structure
- Each folder contains a sample structure with files. Begin by running the samples and exploring the contents of each folder and file, especially the documentation folder (gptDetectives-docs/).
- To respect the documentation structure, modify the file in src/sections.js and add the sections by copying them into the folder sections for each respective documentation created.
