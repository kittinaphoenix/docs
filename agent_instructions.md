GPT Detectives - Agent Instructions
1. GPT Detectives - Game Description
-GPT Detectives is a multiplayer online game where players train their own GPTs based on the standard transformers and fine-tune them, generating layers of fine-tuning. The game features an in-game market where users can buy and sell these fine-tuned layers using the game's cryptocurrency, which is built on an Ethereum 2.0 PoS-compatible blockchain system.
-Key features of the game include:
Multiplayer gameplay: Users can compete against each other, showcasing their GPTs' performance in various challenges.
GPT Training: Players train their GPTs using open-source libraries like GPT-J and GPT-2. They can adjust their GPTs by fine-tuning and create unique AI models.
3D graphics and mobile-friendly: The game is designed with 3D graphics and ensures compatibility with mobile devices for a seamless gaming experience.
Education and earnings: The game aims to educate players about transformers and their underlying technology. Players can earn in-game cryptocurrency, which can be traded in external markets.
In-game market: Users can buy and sell fine-tuned GPT layers, generating a dynamic economy within the game.
Inspiration from similar games: The agent should research popular games like Axie Infinity and crypto miners to gain insights and create an engaging gaming experience.
The game should be built using open-source libraries and tools, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of users. The end goal is to create an engaging and educational game where players can learn about transformers and potentially earn in-game rewards that have real-world value.
